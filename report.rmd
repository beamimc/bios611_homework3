# Task 1 - Clusters and the Gap Statistic

![](figures/gap_estimated_k_vs_side_length.png)

In this simulation, the dimensionality (n) determines both the number of features and the number of cluster centers, because the cluster centers were placed at the positive corners of an n-dimensional hypercube. Thus, increasing n increases the number of clusters in the dataset.

The results show that as n increases from 2 to 6, the Gap Statistic becomes less robust, requiring greater separation between cluster centers (larger side_length) to correctly recover all n clusters.

For lower-dimensional cases (e.g., 2 or 3 dimensions → 2–3 clusters), the method identifies the correct number of clusters even when the centers are relatively close (lower side_length).

For higher-dimensional cases with more clusters (e.g., 5 or 6 clusters), the estimated number of clusters collapses to 1 once the side_length drops below ~3-4.

Overall, the Gap Statistic struggles more when many clusters are packed into a space with limited separation.
